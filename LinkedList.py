"if name == main" makes it so the code will run in the file it is written in but when it is imported it will not run.

The value of name is equal to main in the file it is executed in but is not equal to main in a file it is imported in.

Question 3.1 
(type your answer here)

The issue is the object does not have access to the function get make model which is in the parent class.
The super function allows the object calls the constructor of the parent class and also gives access to the functions and attributes of the parent class.
